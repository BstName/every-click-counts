Plugin for YOURLS 1.5+: Every Click Counts

# What for

This plugin, aptly named "Every Click Counts", is for counting every click. That is, including multiple clicks for the same client. This is done by simply not caching the 301 redirects. 

# How to

* In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `every-click-counts`
* Drop these files in that directory
* Go to the Plugins administration page and activate the plugin 
* Have fun (with counts in large amounts)
